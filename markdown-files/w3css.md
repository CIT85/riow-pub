## Chapter - 1 (0:00 to 0:14:50)

In the video Dave will change his folder for each lesson, but for our work we will name the folder for the week and subject we are coding along with, so for this week it will be w3_css (week 3 css). Code along and create the index.html and before you start the css. 

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "setup for week 3 css done"**

* Create a new markdown file in your w3_css folder and name it css.md and in there write our understanding of what cascading means. Use a heading in the markdown with text "What is cascading" and once you write the inline style before it is delete, commit

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "external, internal and inline styles"**

* Take notes in your css.md with heading "CSS Ruleset".  

* If you installed the W3C extension for validating HTML, you can also use it for CSS!! NICE! If not then make sure you validate your css. 

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "notes on CSS"**

## Chapter - 2 (0:14:50 to 0:35:57)

* You can find the html content for in the github repo from Dave.  Then code along as he covers selectors. In your css.md take a few notes on why using id in your css.  Then continue coding along with Dave and commit right after he deletes the CSS universal selector.

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "how selectors work"**

* Continue to code along with Dave and in your css.md take a few notes 
about specificity and inheritance. MAKE sure you are using Chrome DevTools here! In your notes what is DRY? Great points about form elements not inheriting the font settting from body! Note the !important and why you should not use it. Link to specificty calculator:

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "specificity, inheritance and do not use !"**

## Chapter - 3 (0:35:57 to 0:51:50)

* You can copy the html code from the github repo from Dave here. Then code along with Dave as he show us about color and css. In your css.md make sure you note the different way to specificy color. Great to learn about how VSCODE color picker makes it fun to work with color wheel.
