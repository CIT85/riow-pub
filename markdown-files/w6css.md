https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXGznpKZ_sA


## Chapter - 16 (4:46:51 to 5:32:34)

In the video Dave will change his folder for each lesson, but for our work we will name the folder for the week and subject we are coding along with, so for this week it will be w6_css (week 6 css). Setup the normal files we have been using index.html, style.css (in a css folder) and download images from the starter code in a img folder.  

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "setup for week 6 css done"**

* Code along as we learn about new ways to style images, make sure take notes on how to make images responsive and how text and images work together.  After Dave comments out the section we just wrote, commit.

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "images and display:block"**

* Continue to code along and learn see how to combine image with flex to create "hero" styling.  After Dave codes the utility class, commit.


* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "hero styling and util classes"**

* Now learn about how to style hero class with Dave and the wonderful declaration of background-size:cover;. For sure take notes on Dave's suggestion of image size and optimization here in your CSS.md file. Before Dave return to styling the text, commit:


* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "background color, image, repeat and size"**

* Continue coding along with Dave as we learn more about how to add a the container class and move some of the styles around and also fine-tune the hero styling. After Dave show us how to change the position of the image in the background, commit. 

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "container class and background position"**

* Code along with the last 2 examples for this chapter and see how to style and layer the body with images.  Be careful and watch carefully the background-image line.  Then code the last example background-clip, make sure you look it up on caniuse.com. Good that Dave is talking about prefixes, here so make note of that!  What does he mean by fall back here?  Tell me in your CSS.md file, then after Dave covers the shorthand for background, commit.

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "clip styling, prefix and shorthand"**

## BREAKS ARE IMPORTANT (Optional)

Because you have worked hard to get to this point:
* I recommend you submit your github history URL and finish the  chapter 17 tomorrow.  
* This is optional and if you are feel you are able to keep focused them continue on.  
* If you missed the first due date for this work and you are trying to use this break to get caught up, complete the entire code along work for this item and I will reduce your points by 10% and not the normal late work reduction of 25%. Reach out if you have questions about this option. 


## Chapter - 17 (5:32:34 to 5:59:59)

* Setup the files for this chapter and then commmit.


* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "chp 17 setup"**


* Take a few notes about viewport and media querires in your CSS.md as you code along.  You can find that notes.md file in your Dave's repo and if you want check out that markdown extension. Copy the notes.md into the working folder.


* Really good to slow down there and see the approach Dave take to styling the page, before working on the media query (mq), so commit.

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "page layout before mq"**

* Now code along as we see how mq is coded for page layout resolution breakpoints. After coding the mq, Dave shows some really good options in devTools.  If you don't see the device frames you would need to download them into your system.  

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "coding mq and devtools"**
