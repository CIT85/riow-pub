## Chapter - 1 (00:00 to 12:44)

* Make sure you have downloaded and install Chrome on your system
* Dark Tab is optional
* Your should already have VSCODE downloaded and installed.
* In your pri repo create a new folder and name it w1_html (our file naming convention will be lower case and no spaces)
* Code along as Dave demostrates the basic HTML tags. 
* I do recommend installing the Prettier extension in VSCODE. 
* I do recommend having the auto-save set in VSCODE.

* Live Server is highly recommendated.
* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "setup and basic tag"**

## Chapter - 1  (12:44 to 19:58) 

* Stop the video and code up the CSS as Dave demostrates.
* Walk thru the W3C validation check and update the html along with Dave and make sure your html code validates before you continue, click for validator - https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_upload

## Chapter - 2 (19:58 to 28:52)

* Code along with Dave as he add more meta data and the head section. You can find the ico file here: 	https://github.com/gitdagray/html_course/blob/main/02_lesson/html5.png,  you can right click and save it into the current folder (w1_html) or move it from the downloaded folder to the current folder. 
* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "adding some meta data"**
* Continue coding along with Dave to create the external stylesheet and name it main.css. 
* Create the error and run the validation. 

## Chapter - 3 (28:52 to 49:36)
* Code along with Dave to learn about text content, give that keyboard shortcut a try!  I noticed mine did not change the h2 ending tag, I found the fix here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51803668/visual-studio-code-how-to-automatically-change-the-matching-closing-tag
* It is important to understand the heirachy of the headings and create the horiztonal rule and understand white space collapsing.  
* Code along as Dave as some content, you can make up your own content. 
* Then listen carefully as Dave discusses block vs inline elements.  
* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "block vs inline text"**
* Code along to and learn about entities and learn about <abbr> and how it is not accessible, but <address> does.
* Code along with adding comment into your code. 
* Validate your file again and make sure you have valid html code
* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "entities"**
