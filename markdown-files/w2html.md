# Code Along Instruction for Chapter 4 to 6
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJgBOIoGihA

In the video Dave will change his folder for each lesson, but for our work we will name the folder for the week and subject we are coding along with, so for this week it will w2_html (week 2 HTML).  Copy the code from w1_html into the current week. 
* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "setup for week 2 done"**

---
## Chapter - 4 (49:36 to 59:56)

* Code along with Dave and learn about list, it is good productivity practice to also learn about the keyboard shorts.
* Commit after he covers ol, ul and dl. Make sure your code has been validated.
* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "od, ul, and dl"**

### W3C Validation Extension
I'll cover this in the video for this week, but at this point I installed W3C Web Validator v1.3.1, it worked great and was much quicker than uploading the file. 

### Prettier and W3C Validation
I have also noticed that prettier is creating some issues with self closing tags.  I'll return here to update my findings later. 

## Chapter - 5 (59:56to 1:30:33)
* Code along with dave as you learn about hyperlinks. Make sure you understand the different type of link discussed here.  Absolute vs Relative. Attempt the file creation and before you move, do the following:

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "my attempt at creating the about.html page"**

* Update anything you missed and use word wrap (View >> Word Wrap or ctrl + z) if you want to have the the p tag wrap.  

* Continue coding with Dave to create the different type of links on the page, once you create the bottom of the page anchor page and Dave talks about best practices for writing link tags, stop and commit.

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "types of links"**

* Continue  coding with Dave and learn about the some of the other types of link you can create.  

* HEADSUP if you have our base folder open here (CIT85FA23)the ```<a href="/">``` will not work as excepted.  This is why I will open the folder (rio-pri) that I am working on to have the folder be the "root" folder.  Make sure you validate your code and then commit.

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "download, mail, tel links and other attitudes"**

## BREAKS ARE IMPORTANT (Optional)

Because you have worked hard to get to this point, I recommend you submit your github history URL and finish the last chapter tomorrow.  

## Chapter - 6 (1:30:33 to 2:00:33) 

* Code along and create the new image folder (img) inside w2_html and then select the images in the this 06_lesson folder and once you click on each one right click and save image as and select the folder to same them into or after they are downloaded move them into the img folder we just created. 

* Make sure you listen carefully as Dave discussed current practices for coding images, understand "below the folder" and attitubes for loading images. Make sure you add the br (yes 150) and learn about how to btest the lazy loading of images in Chome devTools. 

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "adding 2 images and lazing loading"**

* Remove the br's and continue doing with Dave and add the figure and figcaption tags and the how to the the code tag. Validate your code and also learn about the different resources and tools for working with images. Take note of the site for future reference.

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "figure, figcaption, code"**

## Congratations
You have finished your second code along for our class, push your code to github and give your commit history URL for the w2_html folder to show you have completed this work.
