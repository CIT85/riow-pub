https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXGznpKZ_sA


## Chapter - 8 (2:16:13 to 2:32:05)

In the video Dave will change his folder for each lesson, but for our work we will name the folder for the week and subject we are coding along with, so for this week it will be w5_css_p1 (week 5 css part 1). I'll cover how I setup this folder in this week's video. 

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "setup for week 5 css done"**

* Code along as Dave covers styling list, you can either comment out the different selectors he shows (recommended) or just code along. You can find the checkmark.png on Dave's site, so go get that item image and save it into a folder name images. After he styles the ul, commit. 

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "styling ol and ul"**

* Code along as Dave commit styles the li, make note in your CSS.md file how to recognize a pseudo element. At the end of this chapter, commit.

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "styling li, pseudo element and using value attribute"**

## Chapter - 9 (2:16:13 to 2:44:39)

* Setup the index.html and style.css as shown by Dave and then commit.

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "chp9 setup done"**

* Code along as Dave did a mini project!  After Dave styles the nav and the h2, commit.

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "css rset, styling nav and h2"**

* Continue to code along as Dave finishes the page and the chapter, in your CSS.md file add a new markdown heading name mini project and tell me what you learned from coding this project, commit

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "styling li for menu, intro to display block, and updated CSS.md file"**

## Chapter - 10 (2:44:39 to 2:44:39)

* I would suggest that you create a new folder and copy the ending files from the mini project, so you can have them for the future.  (optional, but recommended)

* Now setup files for this chapter and commit.

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "chp 10 setup done"**

* Code along with Dave and take a few notes in your CSS.md file. Make sure you write something about how the display: inline-block, inline, block and when do you apply them.  Before Dave moves on to the nav sytling, commit.

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "how display works"**

* Code along until the end of the chapter as Dave styles the nav, commit

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "styling the nav"**

## BREAKS ARE IMPORTANT (Optional)

Because you have worked hard to get to this point:
* I recommend you submit your github history URL and finish the last 2 chapters tomorrow.  
* This is optional and if you are feel you are able to keep focused them continue on.  
* If you missed the first due date for this work and you are trying to use this break to get caught up, complete the entire code along work for this item and I will reduce your points by 10% and not the normal late work reduction of 25%. Reach out if you have questions about this option. 

## Chapter - 11 (2:44:39 to 3:12:41)

* Setup for this chapter and commit.

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "chp 11 setup done"**

* Code along as Dave shows us how floats work, after he codes the right class, commit

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "float left and right"**

* Code along as Dave shows how creating a container (using section) affects floats and the modern way to fix page flow issues. At the end of the chapter Dave does a really good job summarizing these concepts, so make sure you take a few notes in your CSS.md file.  

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "clear and display: root-flow"**

## Chapter - 12 (3:12:419 to 3:34:30)

* Setup for this chapter and commit.

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "chp 12 setup done"**

* Code along as we learn about how to create columns in css!  After Dave discusses the top margin and how to fix that and introduces us to the term margin colapse, commit

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "columns rule grap and margin"**

* Continue to code along with Dave and code the unicode character and column span!  That was fun!!  Make sure you are checking the site to see the css specificity!  https://specificity.keegan.st/ In your CSS.md notes a few notes about what you learned this chapter, commit.

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "unicode characters, columns and nowrap"**
