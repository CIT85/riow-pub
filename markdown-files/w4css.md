## Chapter - 4 (0:51:08 to 1:11:15)

In the video Dave will change his folder for each lesson, but for our work we will name the folder for the week and subject we are coding along with, so for this week it will be w4_css (week 4 css). Code along and create the index.html and before you start the css code along.

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "vw vh"**

## Chapter - 5 (1:11:15 to 1:27:15)

* Update the h1 with content CSS Box model.  You can use the keyboard short-cut for getting into DevTools, but I generally just right click on the page and select inspect.  

* I did noticed by margin on the computed was a bit different then what Dave's screen was showing.  I believe this will be fine. 

* In you CSS.md take a few notes on the box model output on devTools.

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "border raduis to create cirle"**


## BREAKS ARE IMPORTANT (Optional)

Because you have worked hard to get to this point:
* I recommend you submit your github history URL and finish the last chapter tomorrow.  
* This is optional and if you are feel you are able to keep focused them continue on.  
* If you missed the first due date for this work and you are trying to use this break to get caught up, complete the entire code along work for this item and I will reduce your points by 10% and not the normal late work reduction of 25%. Reach out if you have questions about this option. 

## Chapter - 6 (1:37:03 to 2:00:31)

* You can grab the html off Dave's github repo and remove the css from chapter 5.  

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "setup for chapter 6 done"**

* Code along with Dave as he cover typography.  When he cover the different text declaration (decoration, transform,align, indent), don't delete, just comment them out, so you have them in the future. 

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "text declarations"**

* Continue as Dave covers line-height, letter-spacing and word spacing and like we did for the text above, comment out don't delete.  When Dave cover the font-family fall back, make sure you take notes in your CSS.md file how fall back works and how quotes work. Before Dave goes to Google fonts, commit.


* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "more on fonts"**

* Code along as Dave covers Google Fonts and how to include them into your index and css files, using both the link and import methods.  

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "how to use google fonts"**

## Chapter - 7 (2:00:31 to 2:12:15)
* Setup the content and styles as Dave shows, remember you can grab the content from this github site. Once you have it setup, commit

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "setup for chapter 7 done"**

* Then code along to learn about style links, in your CSS.md, take note of what is pseudo class and how specificity and order works with links.  

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "anchor psudeo class and specificity"**
