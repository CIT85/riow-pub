https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXGznpKZ_sA


## Chapter - 18 (5:58:40 to 6:32:34)

In the video Dave will change his folder for each lesson, but for our work we will name the folder for the week and subject we are coding along with, so for this week it will be w7_css (week 7 css). 

You can use the files from W6_css, or setup them up from Dav's repo, either way setup the normal files we have been using index.html, style.css (in a css folder) and download images from the starter code in a img folder.  

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "setup for week 7 css done"**


* See the final project we will be creating in this chapter! FUN STUFF! Now code along with Dave as we start by setting up the nav and footer structure and content.  Before Dave start to code the css, commit.

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "nav and footer structure and content"**

* Code along as Dave start the styling several different parts of the card project, before he starts on the media queries, commit.

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "card project styling"**

* Now code along with Dave as he handles the different break points in the media queries for the different sizes and orientation, commit. 

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "media queries for card project"**

## BREAKS ARE IMPORTANT (Optional)

Because you have worked hard to get to this point:
* I recommend you submit your github history URL and finish the  chapter 19 tomorrow.  
* This is optional and if you are feel you are able to keep focused them continue on.  
* If you missed the first due date for this work and you are trying to use this break to get caught up, complete the entire code along work for this item and I will reduce your points by 10% and not the normal late work reduction of 25%. Reach out if you have questions about this option. 


## Chapter - 19 (6:32:34 to 5:59:59)

* Starter files are form last chapter.


* Follow along as Dave revisits pseudo classes and pseudo element, after Dave covers :not, commit. 

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - ":is, :anylink, :target, :not"**

* Continue coding along with nth-child and how it handled with media queries and the html placement, then Dave will cover pseudo elements, 


* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "::before ::after ::first-letter, ::first-line"**


## Congratations
You have finished your 8th code along for our class, push your code to github and give your commit history URL for the w7_css folder to show you have completed this work.
