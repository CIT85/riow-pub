https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXGznpKZ_sA


## Chapter - 13 (3:34:30 to 3:57:48)

In the video Dave will change his folder for each lesson, but for our work we will name the folder for the week and subject we are coding along with, so for this week it will be w5_css_p2 (week 5 css part 2). I'll cover how I setup this folder in this week's video. 

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "setup for week 5 css done"**

* Code along as Dave starts to cover position, make sure you take a few notes in your CSS.md file regarding how position works.  Continue to code and learn about relative, fixed, and sticky and then before the second example, commit

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - position - absolute, relative, fixed and sticky"**

* Then comment out the html code from above and uncomment the second html example code.  Code along until right before Dave covered covers the footer style and commit. 


* **COMMIT MESSAGE - positiong example started"**

* Then continue to code along with the example and once done, commit.

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "postitiong example finished"**

* I would suggest doing a bit more playing around with the second example!!

## Chapter - 14 (3:57:48 to 4:21:39)

### Notice the resolultion on Dave's screen

* I'll cover this in the video for this code along. 

 Code along as Dave covers display: flex and the many different declarations to implement flex in your css. This is another great way to take a few notes in your CSS.md.  After Dave covers flex-flow shorthand commit.

 * **COMMIT MESSAGE - "display flex and associated declarations"**

* Continue to code along and learn about using flex on the items in container. 

* Check out the https://flexboxfroggy.com and get to at least level 15, take a printscreen of your level name it flex_level.png, resize it,  create a new folder in w5_css_p2 named img and place that folder. 

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "chp14 and frog printscreen done"**


## Chapter - 15 (4:21:39 to 4:47:27)

* Setup the files and then commit.

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "chp 5 setup done"**

* Code along as Dave covers display:grid on the container class and on the box class for the items.  Make sure you open Chrome DevTools and see how to select to show the grid overlay. 


* **COMMIT MESSAGE - " starting display:grid"**

* Continue to adding the short-hand for grid-column and grid-row and nesting grid. It is fun to see the layout come together!  

Check out the https://cssgridgarden.com/ and get to at least level 15, take a printscreen of your level name it garden_level.png, resize it, place it into the img folder we create above. 

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "chp15 and garden printscreen done"**
