# Code Along Instruction for Chapter 7 to 9
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJgBOIoGihA

In the video Dave will change his folder for each lesson, but for our work we will name the folder for the week and subject we are coding along with, so for this week it will be w3_html (week 3 HTML).  Copy the code from w2_html into the current week. 
* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "setup for week 3 done"**

## Chapter - 7 (2:00:59 to 2:26:01)

* Code along with Dave and learn about semantic (meaning) tags we have already used and get introduced to new semantic tags. Commit right before Dave start to discuss changing the section tags.
* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "header, main, footer"**

* Continue to code along and learn about articles, aside, summary, details and mark. It was nice to see how the p tag worked with the details. After Dave uses time tag, commit.
* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "more semantic tags"**

* I'll cover this in the video for this item, if you are unable to get the extension to show up, which happened to be me, I'll show you how to get that to show. I do recommend using the extension Dave discusses for showing the semantic outline. 

* Great comments about div and span!! 

* In this chapter Dave discusses the general guildelines for how and where to use the semantic tags.  Create a new markdown file name it semantic.md and in side that file write your understanding of the guidelines Dave discussed.  You can also do some additional research and/or re-watch this section.  

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "my understanding of semantic useage guidelines"**

## Chapter - 8 (2:26:01 to 2:40:01)

* Code along and learn how to code tables. Right after Dave applies the css to the table commit.

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "tables tags and css"**

* Open Chrome DevTools and follow along with Dave. 

* Code along with Dave add the semantics tags thead, tbody scope attribute, then commit. It was good learn about how the scope is easier then using id's. Make sure you validate your code, but I generally do this after each commit so I catch it early. 

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "table headings, row and column spans"**

## BREAKS ARE IMPORTANT (Optional)

Because you have worked hard to get to this point:
* I recommend you submit your github history URL and finish the last chapter tomorrow.  
* This is optional and if you are feel you are able to keep focused them continue on.  
* If you missed the first due date for this work and you are trying to use this break to get caught up, complete the entire code along work for this item and I will reduce your points by 10% and not the normal late work reduction of 25%. Reach out if you have questions about this option. 

## Chapter - 9 (2:40:01 to 3:25:33) 

* Code along with Dave and create the anchor link and the article and heading for the contact me form.  Once the first name input field is complete. 

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "first name input on form complete"**

* Code along and create last name, password and phone. Dave does touch on regular expression here!  If you want to know more, I suggest chatGPT it does a good job on explaining this in more detail.  

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "last name, password and phone form inputs complete"**

* Code along and create decade and the coffee select inputs for the form.  It was really fun to learn about the optgroup tag!  

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "decade input and coffee select tag complete"**

* Continue to code along as Dave show an alternative to the select, you can pause the video and write the code on the screen. After adding the fav food fieldset commit.

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "fieldset for fav food"**

* Continue to code with Dave and create the fieldsets and inputs for pets, and message using textarea, commit before doing the submit button.

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "radio, checkbox and textarea input types"**

* Now code the submit, post and reset button and learn how to see the form submission data from the action on the form. Good to know the difference between the get and post methods on a form! Make sure to validate.

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "submit, reset and post buttons and httpbin output"**

## Congratations
You have finished your second code along for our class, push your code to github and give your commit history URL for the w3_html folder to show you have completed this work.
